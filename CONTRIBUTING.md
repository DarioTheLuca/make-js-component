### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue please follow these steps:

1. search existing Issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this already)
2. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible
3. if you wish to work on the Issue please check the relative checkbox

### Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

1. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you
2. after the Issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it
3. **only** start working on this Issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you.
4. when forking the issue, create a branch for your edits
5. reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example `closes #123`)
6. please do **not** force push to your PR branch, this makes it very difficult to re-review - commits will be squashed when merged
